# SnakeGameCPP
A take on a classic game of "Snake", made for educational purposes using c++ programming language (and SDL2 library)

## To run the game code, you need to install:
1. C++ 11
2. SDL2

## How to play?
The game is started automatically when launched. You play as snake and your goal is to eat as much apples as you can.
Press arrows to turn your snake. Eating apples will not only increase your score, but also the size of your snake. But be careful as the game becomes more difficult the bigger you are!
If you've lost, press spacebar to play again.
